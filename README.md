# BitNet WebGPU PoC

An experimental proof-of-concept aimed at running 1-bit AI models (like Microsoft's BitNet b1.58) natively in JavaScript using WebGPU.

## The Goal
Standard AI relies on heavy floating-point (`f32`) matrix multiplication, which creates a massive memory bottleneck. This PoC explores rewriting the core mathematical kernels in WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language) to use ternary weights (-1, 0, 1). 

By replacing complex multiplication with simple addition and subtraction directly on the GPU, we aim to drastically reduce memory bandwidth and make running massive Large Language Models in the browser a reality.

## Current Status
- [x] Initial Repository Setup
- [ ] WebGPU environment configuration
- [ ] WGSL Compute Shader for ternary math 
- [ ] Node.js headless execution test
